           <h2>About Me</h2> 

 

            <p>Since I was a child, I was interested in everything related to computers. I am also a very 
                creative person by nature. When I combined these two factors about myself, I realized that Web 
                development is my true calling. In order to realize my dream of one day being a Web developer,
                 I went to the School of Graphics, Design and Media Production in Zagreb to study Web Design. 
                 After the second year, I chose training for a front end developer.</p>
            
            <p>I justify my desire for knowledge by hoping that one day I will open my own company 
                that will give many people jobs and stable life for themselves and their families. I think 
                everyone deserves an equal chance at a normal life. Right now, major IT companies are 
                based in the USA, China, India, etc., but I would like to expand that to New Zealand, 
                Africa, Latin America, and poorer parts of Europe. Studying at RIT would give me a 
                picture of how life works outside Croatia. With magnificent offers for student exchange 
                and open communication with all campuses, I can create long-term relationships that 
                can help me achieve my dream.</p>
