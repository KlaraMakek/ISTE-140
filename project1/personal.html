        <div class="left-per">
            <h2 style="color:#7954A1;">My realization</h2>
            <p>Since I was a child, I was interested in everything related to computers. I am also a very creative
                person by nature. When I combined these two factors about myself, I realized that Web development is my
                true
                calling. In order to realize my dream of one day being a Web developer, I went to the School of
                Graphics,
                Design and Media Production in Zagreb to study Web Design. After the second year, I chose training for a
                front
                end developer.</p>
            <h2 style="color:#7954A1;">My passion</h2>
            <p>I am an open-minded person. I love learning new things and broadening my horizons. I am a team player
                and I love helping others. Years of walking around competitions and gatherings have taught me what it's
                like to work in a team and help each other. I am very passionate about my job and I really appreciate
                it. I
                am a very loyal person when it comes to work and my loved ones.</p>

            <img src="assets/media/img2.jpg" alt="Picture of me." style="width:300px;">
        </div>
        <div class="right-per">
            <h2 style="text-align:right; color:#7954A1;">Why choose me</h2>
            <p>Like I said before. I am willing to sacrifice myself for my job and learn to improve. I accept criticism
                very well and take it as an incentive. My knowledge may seem insufficient, but I assure you I am able to
                convince you otherwise. And if you think that my knowledge is not enough for them, I am ready to go to
                training
                and learn new skills as best I can.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align:right; color:#7954A1;">My hobbies</h2>
            <p>As a person who really likes to spend time outside, I do that a lot. Hiking is one of my favorite
                activities and takes up a lot of my time on weekends. Although sometimes I prefer to go for coffee with
                friends in the morning to discuss the news in the world and our lives. Another of my extremes is
                robotics. I love 3D printing parts for simple projects and assembling diodes and chips. Expanding my
                knowledge about robots and the C#/C++ language is like a small reward.</p>
