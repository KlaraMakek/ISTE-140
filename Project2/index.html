            <i>You can think of the entire Internet as a place where ideas embodied in
                cyberspace are having a war, and it's not much different than the war of gods in heaven, which has been
                taking place since there's been human beings.

            <h1>The internet</h1>
            <p>Various computer networks all across the world may now link thanks to the Internet, a system design that
                has transformed communications and techniques of trade. The Internet, often known as a "network of
                networks," first appeared in the United States in the 1970s, but it wasn't until the early 1990s that it
                was made widely accessible. It was predicted that 4.5 billion people, or more than half of the world's
                population, will have access to the Internet by 2020.<sup><a href="references.html">[2]</a></sup></p>
            <p>Every person who connects to one of its constituent networks has access to the Internet's vast and
                all-encompassing capabilities, which may be utilized for virtually any purpose that relies on
                information. It provides human contact through social media, e-mail, "chat rooms," newsgroups, and audio
                and video transmission and enables teamwork across several locations. Many programs, like the World Wide
                Web, can use it to access digital information. A vast and expanding number of "e-businesses" that
                conduct the majority of their sales and services online, including subsidiaries of conventional
                "brick-and-mortar" enterprises, have found success on the Internet.<sup><a href="references.html">[2]</a></sup></p>

            <h1>World Wide Web</h1>
            <p>The Web, often known as the World Wide Web (WWW), is the top Internet information retrieval service (the
                worldwide computer network). Hypertext or hypermedia links, often known as hyperlinks, are electronic
                connections that connect similar bits of information to offer a user simple access to them. The Web
                provides users with access to a wide variety of documents that are connected to one another through
                these links. The user can visit other papers that contain more information on a word or phrase by
                selecting it from text that contains hypertext. Links to videos, animations, sounds, and photos can be
                found in hypermedia documents.<sup><a href="references.html">[3]</a></sup></p>
            <p>The Web operates within the Internet's basic client-server format; servers are computer programs that
                store and transmit documents to other computers on the network when asked to, while clients are programs
                that request documents from a server as the user asks for them. Browser software allows users to view
                the retrieved documents.<sup><a href="references.html">[3]</a></sup>
