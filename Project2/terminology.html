            <h1>Terminology</h1>

            <h2>Internet</h2>
            <p>The Internet is a large network that links computers all over the world. People may exchange information and interact through the Internet from any location that has an Internet connection. <a href="references.html">[1]</a></p>
            <h2>World Wide Web</h2>
            <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), sometimes known as the Web, is the Internet's primary information retrieval service (the worldwide computer network). The Web provides users with access to a huge array of documents that are linked to one another via hypertext or hypermedia links, electronic connections that link similar bits of information to provide a user quick access to them.<a href="references.html">[2]</a></p>
            <h2>Hypertext</h2>
            <p>A hyperlink is an electronic connection that connects two or more pieces of information to provide a user quick access to them. A hypertext, or text-based hyperlink, is a feature of some computer systems that allows a user of electronic media to choose a word from text and obtain further information about that word, such as a definition or references within the text.<a href="references.html">[3]</a></p>
            <h2>Multimedia</h2>
            <p>Multimedia is a phrase used to represent two or more forms of media merged into a single package, generally signifying a mix of any or all of the following: video, sound, animation, text, and images. The usage of multimedia allows the user to affect the display of information.<a href="references.html">[4]</a></p>
            <h2>CLI</h2>
            <p>A Command-line interface (CLI) An interactive system that accepts user input in the form of lines of text. These instructions are taught to the user by reading an online help system or a reference handbook. Users who are already familiar with the interface can utilize acronyms or mnemonic instructions to speed up access and minimize the amount of keystrokes necessary for a specific command.<a href="references.html">[5]</a></p>
            <h2>GUI</h2>
            <p>A graphical user interface (GUI)  is a computer environment that facilitates user interaction by expressing programs, instructions, files, and other choices as visual components like as icons, pull-down menus, buttons, scroll bars, windows, and dialog boxes. The user may commence several operations, such as opening a program or printing a document, by selecting one of these graphical components, either with a mouse or via a menu.<a href="references.html">[6]</a></p>
            <h2>HCI</h2>
            <p>A human-computer interface (HCI), a communication between a human user and a computer system, namely the usage of input/output devices and related software. Graphics gadgets, touch-sensitive devices, and voice-input devices are examples. They must be designed in such a way that a human and a computer may communicate in an efficient and desired manner.<a href="references.html">[7]</a></p>
            <h2>SFTP</h2>
            <p>SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is a file transfer protocol that is secure. It operates via the SSH protocol. It provides complete SSH security and authentication capability. As a file transfer protocol, SFTP has mostly superseded classic FTP and is rapidly overtaking FTP/S.<a href="references.html">[8]</a></p>
            <h2>SSH</h2>
            <p>SSH, or Secure Shell, is a network communication protocol that allows two computers to connect (c.f. http, or hypertext transfer protocol, which is the protocol used to send hypertext such as web pages) and exchange data. Because the communication between the two computers is encrypted, it is acceptable for usage over unsecured networks.<a href="references.html">[9]</a></p>
            <h2>telnet</h2>
            <p>Telnet is a networking protocol that allows you to remotely access a computer system. Remote connections between various computer kinds were required by computer users. <a href="references.html">[10]</a></p>
            <h2>HTTP</h2>
            <p>HTTP, or HyperText Transfer Protocol, is a common application-level protocol used on the World Wide Web to exchange files. HTTP is a protocol that operates on top of the TCP/IP protocol and (eventually) the QUIC protocol.<a href="references.html">[11]</a></p>
            <h2>HTTPS</h2>
            <p> Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is a variation of the conventional web transmission protocol (HTTP) that adds a layer of security to data in transit via an SSL or TLS protocol connection. HTTPS offers secure communication and encrypted communication between a distant user and the principal web server.<a href="references.html">[12]</a></p>
            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>HTML, or hypertext markup language, is a formatting method for presenting information obtained through the Internet. Each retrieval unit is referred to as a Web page (from the World Wide Web), and such pages usually include hypertext connections that enable the retrieval of related sites. HTML is a markup language used to create Web pages.<a href="references.html">[13]</a></p>
            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>CSS is an abbreviation for "Cascading Style Sheet." The layout of Web pages is formatted using Cascading Style Sheets. They can be used to specify font styles, table sizes, and other features of Web pages that were previously solely described in the HTML.<a href="references.html">[14]</a></p>
