            <h1>HTTP</h1>
            <p>HTTP, or HyperText Transfer Protocol, is a standard application-level protocol used on the World Wide Web for
                file exchange. HTTP is built on top of the TCP/IP protocol and (eventually) the QUIC protocol. Web browsers
                are HTTP clients that transmit file requests to Web servers, which then process the requests using an HTTP
                service. Tim Berners-Lee, a contributor of the 1.0 specification, proposed HTTP in 1989. HTTP/1.0 (published
                in 1996) was "stateless," which meant that each new request from a client formed a new connection, rather
                than handling all comparable requests through the same connection between a single client and server. <sup><a href="references.html">[1]</a></sup>
            <p>HTTP/1.1 (introduced in 1997) provides persistent connections, HTML file decompression by client browsers,
                and numerous domain names sharing the same IP address. HTTP/2 (introduced in 2015) was supposed to address
                issues with sluggish page loading and was a binary protocol in which binary values were utilized instead of
                plaintext as in earlier versions. HTTP/3, which uses the speedier QUIC protocol rather of TCP, had not yet
                been published in complete form as of early 2022 but was supported by the majority of browsers. In the
                2010s, many websites began to use HTTPS (Secure HTTP), a protocol invented by Netscape Communications
                Corporation in 1994 that adds the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol to HTTP to offer a layer of encryption
                between browsers and servers.<sup><a href="references.html">[1]</a></sup></p>

            <div class="second">        <p>HTTPS is one of the most crucial protocols for securing communication, and it is thankfully becoming more
                widely utilized. Website security still needs improvement, particularly for the long tail of domains.
                Different user categories are involved with HTTPS, such as administrators who must deal with the principles
                of cryptography and difficult compatibility issues or end users who are compelled to make crucial security
                decisions when confronted with warnings. Research shows that both groups have misunderstandings regarding
                the advantages of security and threat models (surveyed 18 end users and 12 administrators).
                <sup><a href="references.html">[2]</a></sup>
            <p>Pinpoint protocol elements that obstruct safe setups and user conduct and we highlight conceptual gaps
                between administrators and end users. According to findings, administrator mental models are more
                protocol-based, whereas end user mental models are more conceptual. Additionally, discovered that
                administrators frequently lack understanding of the interplay between the functional protocol elements, end
                users frequently confuse encryption with authentication, significantly underestimate the security advantages
                of HTTPS, and ignore and distrust security indicators. Examining the ramifications and offer practical
                suggestions for next user interface and protocol designs based on the various mental models.
