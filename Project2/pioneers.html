                        <p>Douglas Engelbart, (born January 30, 1925, Portland, Oregon, U.S.—died July 2, 2013,
                            Atherton, California), American inventor whose work beginning in the 1950s led to his patent for the computer
                            mouse, the development of the basic graphical user interface (GUI), and groupware.<sup><a href="references.html">[2]</a></sup>
                        </p>
                        <p>Engelbart's vision was to utilize computers to connect people in a network so they could
                            exchange and update information in "real time." He coupled this concept of collaborative software, or groupware.
                            In 1963, SRI partially sponsored Engelbart's own research laboratory, the Augmentation Research Center, where he worked on
                            designing and improving different data input, manipulation, and display methods, such as the computer
                            mouse, multiple-window display, and hypermedia (the linking of texts, images, video, and sound
                            files within a single document).<sup><a href="references.html">[2]</a></sup>

                        <p>Theodor Holm Nelson (born June 17, 1937) is an American pioneer of information technology,
                            philosopher, and sociologist. He coined the terms hypertext and hypermedia in 1963. and published them in
                            1965. Nelson coined the terms transclusion, virtuality, and intertwingularity (in Literary Machines).<sup><a href="references.html">[3]</a></sup>
                        </p>
                        <p>"At the outset of Project XanaduOffsite Link in 1965 (or maybe 1964), Ted Nelson and his aide
                            Calvin Curtin invented the word "hyperlink." Vannevar Bush's popular article "As We May ThinkOffsite Link"
                            had influenced Nelson. In the article, Bush proposed a microfilm-based machine (the Memex) that could link
                            any two pages of information into a "trail" of related material and then scroll back and forth among pages in
                            a trail as if they were on a single microfilm reel. The closest modern parallel would be to create a list
                            of bookmarks to thematically relevant Web pages and then let the user to browse through the list forward and
                            backward.<sup><a href="references.html">[3]</a></sup>

                            anybody could use. Apple's Macintosh computer, released in 1984, offered a graphical user interface and mouse
                            technology that set the standard for all application interfaces. Apple became a public business in 1980, and
                            Jobs was named chairman. The eye-catching new iMac computer (1998) turned around the
                            company's fortunes. Apple became an industry leader and one of the most valuable firms in
                            the world under Jobs' direction. Its other major products include iTunes (2001), the iPod (2001), the iPhone

                        <p>Robert Elliot Kahn (born December 23, 1938) is an American electrical engineer, who, along
                            with Vint Cerf, first proposed the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP), the
                            fundamental communication protocols at the heart of the Internet.<sup><a href="references.html">[11]</a></sup>
                        </p>
                        <p>While working on the SATNET satellite packet network project, he came up with the initial
                            ideas for what later became the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which was intended as a replacement
                            for an earlier network protocol, NCP, used in the ARPANET. TCP played a major role in forming the basis of
                            open-architecture networking, which would allow computers and networks all over the world to
                            communicate with each other, regardless of what hardware or software the computers on each network
                            used.<sup><a href="references.html">[11]</a></sup>

                        <p>Vinton Cerf, in full Vinton Gray Cerf, (born June 23, 1943, New Haven, Connecticut, U.S.),
                            American computer scientist who is considered one of the founders, along with Robert Kahn, of the Internet.”<sup><a href="references.html">[12]</a></sup>
                        </p>
                        <p>Cerf worked in the laboratory of Leonard Kleinrock at UCLA under fellow student Stephen
                            Crocker on the effort to create the communication protocol (Network Control Program [or Protocol]; NCP) for the
                            ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network; see DARPA), the first computer network based on packet
                            switching, an unproven technology at the time. (Unlike traditional telephone communications, which require
                            a dedicated circuit for transmission, packet switching divides a message into "packets" that travel
                            independently over many circuits.) UCLA was one of the four initial ARPANET nodes. Cerf was also involved in
                            the development of software that evaluated and assessed the ARPANET's performance.<sup><a href="references.html">[12]</a></sup>
