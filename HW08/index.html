    <p>Since I was a child, I was interested in everything related to computers. I am also a very
        creative person by nature. When I combined these two factors about myself, I realized that Web
        development is my true calling. In order to realize my dream of one day being a Web developer,
        I went to the School of Graphics, Design and Media Production in Zagreb to study Web Design.
        After the second year, I chose training for a front end developer.</p>

    <p>I justify my desire for knowledge by hoping that one day I will open my own company
        that will give many people jobs and stable life for themselves and their families. I think
        everyone deserves an equal chance at a normal life. Right now, major IT companies are
        based in the USA, China, India, etc., but I would like to expand that to New Zealand,
        Africa, Latin America, and poorer parts of Europe. Studying at RIT would give me a
        picture of how life works outside Croatia. With magnificent offers for student exchange
        and open communication with all campuses, I can create long-term relationships that
        can help me achieve my dream.</p>
